# Diabetic-Retinopathy-Detection-from-Fundus-Images-using-Transfer-Learning
This AI tool helps the common people to identify the occurrence and the stage of the Diabetic Retinopathy disease by giving the fundus image of their eye as input.
Diabetes is a chronic disease impacting millions globally. One major complication is Diabetic Retinopathy  (DR), a condition where elevated blood sugar levels damage the retinal blood vessels, potentially resulting in vision loss.
Traditional diagnostic methods for DR are often time-consuming and require specialized expertise.
This project utilizes the transfer learning technique in deep learning, to develop a simpler, efficient and accurate system  for diabetes detection from fundus images.
An ensemble model that combines three powerful pre-trained architectures—DenseNet121, ResNet50, and EfficientNetB0—to improve detection accuracy is developed.  
We utilize the vast amount of knowledge, that these networks have already acquired from large datasets.
This pre-existing knowledge serves as a strong foundation, allowing our model to recognize and interpret  complex patterns in retinal fundus images more effectively than if trained from scratch.
